# dataviscourse-pr-visualizing-world-crop-production
ATTN MILESTONE GRADER, IN ORDER TO USE:
1) Click on a crop.
2) Click on one or more countries on the world map.
Then the data will be populated in the line and bar charts. The table view in the bottom right is not implemented yet. 

These remarks apply only to the milestone; for the final submission I'll put directions on the webpage or make workflow more intuitive. 

This is my term project for a data visualization course. It creates a website that visualizes data about world crop production using D3.
