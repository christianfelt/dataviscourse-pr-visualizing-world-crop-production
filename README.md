# dataviscourse-pr-visualizing-world-crop-production
This is my term project for a data visualization course. It creates a website that visualizes data about world crop production using D3.

To use the visualization,
1) Click on a crop in the list of crops.
2) Click on one or more countries on the world map or country names in the table.
Then the data will be populated in the line and bar charts.

My JavaScript code is all in the folder js. script.js contains the entry point to the program, while the other files contain code relevant to the views they are named for. The data folder contains my data, consisting of the 5 crop production files, the world.json file, and the cmu5.csv file which I use only to map country names to their ISO codes. The assets folder contains the images of crops used in the guided tours panel. world-crop-visualization.html contains the html skeleton for the visualization. It is embedded in an iFrame in index.html, which is the entry point for my GitHub Pages website. styles.css is for world-crop-visualization.html and indexStyles.css is for index.html.
